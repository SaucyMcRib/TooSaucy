      <td>Aluminum boats</td>
      <td>Me and my group make a little disc of tinfoil. This was supposed to teach problem solving.</td>
      <td>This one seemed a little silly to me. One person found a great design and then everyone just copied them.</td>

      <td>Whats a computer</td>
      <td>We went over the definition of a computer and then sorted them into groups.</td>
      <td>This was worth my time and I had to think about how many computers are around us. Hundreds.</td>

      <td>Making a webpage</td>
      <td>You are seeing the results of this now. I did a lot of outside work and I think it showed in the webpage.</td>
      <td>I was pumped when I heard about this and it has been really fun to create.
          I feel like this is something I could do for a job because it is challenging and fun.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>M and M data analysis</td>
       <td>We procured a question that was related to M&M's. Next we had to collect data to answer our question. Our question
         was "What percentage of M&M's are defective?". Here is the data we found.<li><a href="mm_lab.html">Data Sheet</a></li> </td>
       <td>My thoughts were that I didnt really learn anything from this except that Google Spreadsheets 
         had a built-in graph maker.</td>
