       <h1> Hello </h1>
    <p> Heres where you can find all of my Hobbies.<br></p>
    <h3> Skiing <br></h3>
    <p> I have always loved to ski. In stardted when i was around 5 or 6. I love the feeling of sliding across the snow.<br></p>
    <h3> Gaming <br></h3>
    <p> I started playing simple Scooby Doo disc games on our family laptop quite awhile ago (with help). 
      That is where I started. Now I prefer League of Legends, more about that on the next page.<br></p>
    <h3> Hockey <br></h3>
    <p> I started skating as soon as I could. I have never played hockey on a team, 
      but for me playing with friends on ponds and local outdoor rinks is just fine. </p>
